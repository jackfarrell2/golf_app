#### Description:

My motivation for this project was creating a website that allows me and my friends to keep track of who is having the best golf year. I thought it would be cool to have a website where we could see everyones statistics. We could use the standings to determine a playoff at the end of the year.

The homepage is just the league/club standings. This is determined by a golfers average score. There was lots of information I could have included per golfer but I did not want to overcrowd the page. As such, it includes the golfer name, rounds played, best score to date, average score, and some basic statistics like how average pars per rounds, and scores on each type of hole. 

I spent a good deal of time designing the scorecards. I thought it would look good if the portions of the scorecard that would be handwritten in real life were in a handwritten font. I also added a color scheme for each type of hole. They do this often on TV for pro golfers. I set a bogey as no color instead of a par because we are not pro golfers, so a bogey is a good score. 

I added a "holes" tab. This is a tab where you can see golfers statistics per hole on any selected course. This can be fun to see which holes you are struggling on and which holes you traditionally do very well on. You can also see what your general "pace" on the course is. Meaning, you can see that you are usually 10 over through the eigth hole for example. This means if you are only 8 over through the eight hole, you know you are playing pretty well.

The "VS" tab only pulls scorecards and data from rounds of two selected golfers. This is nice because sometimes you are not interested in just your stats for the year, you want to see round history against a specific golfer (bragging rights). I decided to display the most basic info (the record between the two, a statline for each golfer, and all the scorecards)

Then there is the "post a match" tab. This allows users to upload their own matches and thus change the standings. After selecting a number of golfers and course, the app will show a scorecard much like the ones above, except with no strokes filled in. You can select from a dropdown menu each golfer and then input scores. If a golfer does not exist or a course does not exist, you can simply click a button and add a course of golfer to the database.

All in all I think the project was a success and I actually believe it will get some use!

I learned how to better think about designing the routes on the app. I had to rework them a few times. I also had to rework the SQL tables a few times. I learned how to think about the design of the web app on the higher level before going in and writing code. 

Thank you CS50!
